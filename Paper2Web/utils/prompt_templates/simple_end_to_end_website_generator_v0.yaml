  Instructions:
  You are creating a complete, beautiful, and interactive website for an academic research project. This is NOT a simple static page - it should be a sophisticated, modern web application with rich interactivity.
  
  
  * **Content Strategy:**
    * **CRITICAL:** You are no longer required to preserve the original, full-length text. The goal is now to create a highly scannable and engaging user experience.
    * You must now summarize and condense the academic content into digestible paragraphs.
    * Based on UI/UX best practices,you should choose 100 to 200 words ,aim for 1-2 focused paragraphs per section to avoid text density and improve readability. Use your professional judgment to determine the optimal length for each section's content.
  
  * **Visual Asset Sizing:**
    * **CRITICAL:** You are no longer required to strictly use `web_width` and `web_height` from `visual_assets`.
    * You are now permitted to use images from **external sources** (e.g., Unsplash, Pexels) if no specific visual asset is allocated, to enhance the professional and modern aesthetic.
    * You must adjust the size of each image dynamically based on its container size and the surrounding page content, ensuring the image is optimally integrated into the visual layout.
    * Use a fluid and responsive approach (e.g., CSS `width: 100%`, `height: auto`, and `max-width` properties) to ensure the images perfectly fit their context without breaking the layout or appearing disproportionately large. The image should have a size that is visually balanced, neither dominating nor getting lost on the page.

  RESEARCH CONTENT:
  {{ research_content | tojson }}

  VISUAL ASSET ALLOCATION:
  {{ visual_assets | tojson }}

  EXTERNAL LINKS AND RESOURCES:
  {{ important_info | tojson }}

  **CRITICAL DATA USAGE REQUIREMENTS:**
  1. **META INFORMATION**: You MUST use the following information from visual_assets.meta:
      - Title: {{ visual_assets.meta.title }}
      - Authors: {{ visual_assets.meta.authors }}
      - Affiliations: {{ visual_assets.meta.affiliations }}
      - Project Name: {{ visual_assets.meta.project_name }}

  2. **IMAGE SIZING AND LAYOUT**:
      - Use responsive design: images should fill their containers appropriately without excessive whitespace
      - For better visual balance, consider using CSS Grid or Flexbox to create optimal image layouts
      - Ensure images are properly centered and sized within their sections
  
  3. **URL INTEGRATION**: You MUST include ALL URLs from important_info:
      - Create a dedicated "Resources & Links" section
      - Integrate these links naturally throughout the content
      - Each link should have clear descriptions and be clickable

  VISUAL ASSET STRATEGY:
  - Use the visual assets (images/tables) according to their allocation in each section.
  - Create engaging visual presentations with proper image galleries and table displays.
  - Ensure visual content enhances the research narrative without overwhelming text.
  - Balance text and visual content for optimal readability and engagement.
  - **CRITICAL: Include ALL URLs from important_info in a dedicated Resources section.**
  - **NEW - Complex Layouts Handling**: Some sections might have a `layout_type` specified, such as "grid". If `visual_assets` for a section contains a list of `items` (each with an `image_path` and a `label`), you MUST generate a CSS Grid or Flexbox container. Iterate through the `items` list and create a card for each item, containing the image and its corresponding label styled as a visible overlay or caption. This is critical for presenting composite figures correctly.


  IMAGE LAYOUT OPTIMIZATION:
  - Use CSS Grid or Flexbox for optimal image placement.
  - Ensure images fill their containers appropriately (use object-fit: contain).
  - Avoid excessive whitespace around images.
  - Use responsive design: max-width: 100% for mobile compatibility.
  - Center images within their sections for better visual balance.
  - Consider using CSS aspect-ratio for consistent image proportions.

  DESIGN REQUIREMENTS:
  1. **Visual Design**: Modern, professional, academic aesthetic with:
      - Sophisticated color scheme (dark/light themes with multiple color variations).
      - Professional typography with proper hierarchy and multiple font weights.
      - Smooth animations and transitions with multiple animation types.
      - Interactive elements and hover effects with complex state changes.
      - Professional spacing and layout with multiple breakpoints.
      - Advanced visual effects (shadows, gradients, transforms).
      - **NEW - Background Style**: Avoid using background images, especially in the hero section, unless an image is explicitly allocated for it. Prefer solid colors (e.g., `#2d3748` dark gray, `#ffffff` white) or subtle gradients for backgrounds to maintain a clean, professional, and academic look. DO NOT fetch images from external sources like Unsplash.

  2. **Layout Structure**: 
      - Hero section with project title, authors, key highlights.
      - Multi-level navigation with smooth scrolling and active state indicators.
      - Content sections with dynamic layouts based on content importance.
      - Interactive visualizations and image galleries with lightbox and carousel.
      - External resources section with strategic link placement and categorization.
      - Footer with additional information, social links, and contact details.
      - Sidebar navigation with quick links and progress indicators.
      - Multiple content columns and grid layouts.
      - Advanced card-based content presentation.

  3. **Interactivity Features**:
      - Smooth scrolling navigation with progress bars and scroll indicators.
      - Interactive image galleries with lightbox, zoom, and slideshow.
      - Animated counters and statistics with number animations.
      - Hover effects and micro-interactions with complex animations.
      - Responsive navigation menu with hamburger menu and dropdowns.
      - Loading animations and transitions with skeleton screens.
      - Interactive charts and data visualizations with tooltips.
      - Modal dialogs and popup windows.
      - Form validation and interactive feedback.
      - Search functionality with autocomplete.
      - Dark/light theme toggle with smooth transitions.

  4. **External Links Integration**:
      - Place important_info links strategically throughout the content.
      - Create dedicated "Resources & Tools" section with categorization.
      - Integrate links naturally within relevant content sections.
      - Use attractive button designs for external links with hover effects.
      - Provide context for each external resource with descriptions.

  TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
  1. **CSS Requirements**:
      - Advanced animations and transitions with multiple timing functions.
      - Responsive design with multiple breakpoints (mobile, tablet, desktop).
      - CSS Grid and Flexbox for modern layouts.
      - CSS custom properties (variables) for theming.
      - Advanced selectors and pseudo-elements.
      - Image centering: single images centered, multiple images in centered rows (max 3 per row).
      - Smooth scrolling and scroll animations.
      - Hover effects and micro-interactions.
      - Professional color schemes with multiple variations.
      - Advanced typography with proper hierarchy.

  2. **JavaScript Requirements**:
      - Modern ES6+ syntax with proper error handling.
      - Interactive image galleries with lightbox functionality.
      - Smooth scrolling navigation with progress indicators.
      - Mobile menu functionality with animations.

      - Performance optimization and error handling.
      - Advanced image handling and gallery features.
      - Form validation and user interaction.
      - Performance optimization and error handling.
      - **Intersection Observer for scroll animations**
      - **Local storage for user preferences**

  3. **Critical JavaScript Best Practices (MUST FOLLOW)**:
      - **DOM Element Access Timing**: ALL DOM element access MUST be wrapped in DOMContentLoaded event listener to ensure elements exist before accessing them.
      - **Intersection Observer Setup**: When using Intersection Observer for fade-in animations:
        * ALWAYS set up the observer BEFORE adding classes to elements
        * Observe elements IMMEDIATELY after adding fade-in classes in the same function
        * NEVER query elements with .fade-in class before setting up the observer
        * Example pattern: `element.classList.add('fade-in'); observer.observe(element);`
      - **Event Listener Safety**: Always check if elements exist before adding event listeners: `if (element) { element.addEventListener(...) }`
      - **Animation Class Management**: For fade-in animations, ensure the CSS class makes elements invisible initially (opacity: 0), and the appear class makes them visible (opacity: 1)
      - **Function Organization**: Wrap DOM-dependent functionality in initialization functions called from DOMContentLoaded

  Remember: This is a professional academic website that should impress visitors with its design quality, interactivity, and content presentation. Make it beautiful, modern, and engaging while maintaining academic credibility.

  CRITICAL CHECKS: |
   1. Overall Typography and Aesthetics
      Instruction: You must ensure the entire page uses a consistent, professional, and aesthetically pleasing typography. Pay close attention to the font choice (e.g., Inter), as well as appropriate letter spacing (letter-spacing) and line height (line-height) to guarantee excellent readability.

    2. Header: Author Prominence is CRITICAL
       Location: Immediately below the main paper title, you MUST prominently display all authors and their corresponding affiliations. This is a standard academic convention and is mandatory.

       Typography: Use a clean, professional sans-serif font (e.g., Inter or Manrope). Author names should be a larger font size and semi-bold (font-semibold), while affiliations should be a smaller font size (text-sm) and regular weight.

      Spacing: Ensure proper horizontal spacing between author entries (gap-x-8) and tight vertical spacing between an author's name and their affiliation to create clear visual groups.

    3. Footer: Citation Section is MANDATORY
     Functionality: Before the footer, you MUST create a dedicated section titled "How to Cite".

     Content: This section must contain a complete, pre-formatted BibTeX block for easy copying by researchers.

     Interaction: The BibTeX block MUST be accompanied by a "Copy" button. This button must use JavaScript to implement one-click copying and provide instant user feedback (e.g., changing text to "Copied!").

    4. THE GOLDEN RULE of Image Sizing (Highest Priority Warning)
    Preamble: This is the most important directive and must not be violated under any circumstances. Incorrect image handling is the primary cause of layout failure.

    STRICTLY FORBIDDEN:

    NEVER use fixed width and height attributes directly in the <img> tag (e.g., <img src="..." width="1200" height="600">).

    Reason: This creates a fixed-size image that will overflow its container and break the page layout on smaller screens.

   ALWAYS DO:

    You MUST ALWAYS control image sizes using responsive CSS. The simplest and most effective method is using Tailwind CSS's w-full class.

    Correct Example: <img src="..." class="w-full rounded-md">

    Principle: w-full translates to width: 100%;, making the image width equal to its parent container. The browser automatically sets height: auto; to maintain the aspect ratio, ensuring a perfect fit on all screen sizes.

   5. Interactivity Enhancement Guide
   To make the page more engaging, you SHOULD incorporate the following interactive effects in the appropriate sections:

    Navigation Bar: Implement a JavaScript "Scroll-Spy" to automatically highlight the navigation link corresponding to the section currently in view.

    Interactive Demo: For sections comparing results, you are strongly encouraged to reference and use a highly interactive animation template (like the ones provided previously) instead of static images to be more persuasive.

    Resource Links: Add elegant hover effects to all buttons, such as a slight scale-up (hover:scale-105) and color transitions, to provide positive user feedback.
  
  
  Your final, complete response must be a single JSON object that strictly adheres to the template provided below. Do not include any text or explanations outside of the JSON structure.
