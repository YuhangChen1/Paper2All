  Instructions:
  You are creating a complete, beautiful, and interactive website for an academic research project. This is NOT a simple static page - it should be a sophisticated, modern web application with rich interactivity.

  RESEARCH CONTENT:
  {{ research_content | tojson }}

  VISUAL ASSET ALLOCATION:
  {{ visual_assets | tojson }}

  EXTERNAL LINKS AND RESOURCES:
  {{ important_info | tojson }}

  LAYOUT WEIGHTS EXPLANATION:
  - tp (Text Proportion): Represents the relative importance of text content in each section. Higher tp means more text content and should be given more visual space.
  - gp (Graphic Proportion): Represents the relative importance of visual elements (images/tables) in each section. Higher gp means more visual content and should be given more visual prominence.

  LAYOUT STRATEGY:
  - Sections with high tp (text-heavy): Use larger text areas, more detailed content display, focus on readability
  - Sections with high gp (visual-heavy): Use larger image areas, carousel displays, interactive visualizations
  - Balance both weights to create optimal visual hierarchy
  - Use CSS Grid and Flexbox for responsive, dynamic layouts
